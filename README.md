ChessStats
==========

All my chess data (puzzle scores, games). These games are not particularly good, I am not responsible for your mental health should you wish to view them.

This project is very much a solo experiment for now.

If you absolutely must have your own:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/ZirconCode/ChessStats.git`
 2. Delete Everything in the games & puzzles folders.
 3. Edit the two variables at beginning of the rakefile.
 4. `rake -T `
 5. `rake update`
